# LCYS-EMA-Project
## Internal Python Port Scanner for checking which ports are open on the Queens Medical Center ASMIS network

<br/>

> IMPORTANT, Please read! The hostname being used in this example is for demonstration purposes only and must be changed to a permissioned target prior to use. This scanner has been developed for a project to scan internally only.

## Pre-requisites
* Python v3.10.6 ([DOWNLOAD HERE](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* An IDE such as PyCharm IDE (Free Community) ([DOWNLOAD HERE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)) if you wish to run it outside of google. Otherwise, Google Colab will run it easily.
* Possible to run the code directly in Google colab if you have a google account ([Link to Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook))

## What to change/Customize prior to usage (Bold areas inticate what needs to be changed)
* print("**Scanning scanme.nmap.org for testing reasons due to permissions.** ")
* target = socket.gethostbyname('**IP Address**', sys.argv[1]) 
* for port in range(**from port, to port**) *example (1,800)*
* socket.setdefaulttimeout(**0.2**)
* result = s.connect_ex(('**IP Address**', port))

#### This particular scan took 2.25 seconds but it can take longer.
#### Scans during testing took between 2.25 seconds and upto 15.19 seconds, depending on the time and system resources 

## Access The Internal Port Scanner
*  ([Internal Port Scanner](https://github.com/Jhines2022/LCYS-EMA-Project/blob/main/EMA_port_scanner.py))

## UML Process to help illustrate the 3 groups of port ranges assigned to systems as well-known ports(0 to 1023), registered ports(1024 to 49151) and private ports (49152â€“65535)
