## Internal Python Port Scanner for checking which ports are open on the Queens Medical Center ASMIS network
#### This python script was put together to help check and mitigate a potential security issue that was highlighted in unit 9s ASMIS Essay.
#### list of Credits and Acknowledgments to information used while learning the "how and why of the parts" of this script are located at the end of this page  

<br/>

> IMPORTANT, Please read! The hostname being used in this example is for demonstration purposes only and must be changed to a permissioned target prior to use. This scanner has been developed for a project to scan internally only.

## Video Demo

#### This video demo of a scan took 15.19 seconds to scan 100 ports but the screenshots will also show that it took just 2.25 seconds on a different day.
#### It appears that the time of day can make a significant difference on a scan of the permissioned target

## Pre-requisites
* Python v3.10.6 ([DOWNLOAD HERE](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* An IDE such as PyCharm IDE (Free Community) ([DOWNLOAD HERE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)) if you wish to run it outside of google. Otherwise, Google Colab will run it easily.
* Possible to run the code directly in Google colab if you have a google account ([Link to Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook))

## What to change/Customize prior to usage (Bold areas inticate what needs to be changed)
* print("**Scanning scanme.nmap.org for testing reasons due to permissions.** ")
* target = socket.gethostbyname('**IP Address**', sys.argv[1]) 
* for port in range(**from port, to port**) *example (1,800), can also refer to the UML at the bottom of the page for Port ranges*
* socket.setdefaulttimeout(**0.2**) *example (1) represents one second, (0.5) represents half of a second.*
* result = s.connect_ex(('**IP Address**', port))

#### This particular scan took 2.25 seconds but it can take longer.
#### Scans during testing took between 2.25 seconds and upto 15.19 seconds, depending on the time and system resources
